## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/oorikooo/TMDB_Test_App.git
  ```
2. Add your API key to the local.properties file in the root of the project. If the file doesn't exist, create it and add the following line:
  ```
  API_KEY="INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
  ```
3. Sync the project

## Building the App

To get better performance (especially for Compose features), you can build a release version of the app. The signing key is already set. You just need to select "Release" build and run the app.
